# Yeury and Hennjer
We worked on developing the front-end application.
  - Front-end technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

# Yeury
I worked on connecting the front-end with the back-end using Flask (a python web framework).
  - I was able to get the data and send it to phidias who handled creating the models for our predictions.
