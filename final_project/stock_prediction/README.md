# Stock Ticker Prediction
## Description
Our goal is to build a web application that predicts how much a stock will cost in a given estimated time by the user. For instance, if the user wanted to predict how much an Apple stock would be tomorrow, we would use a  prediction model to do that, the user will have a chance to choose which prediction model to use from the options we provide. Might be restricted to only a few stocks.

## Roles and Accomplishments
### Yeury and Hennjer
We worked on developing the front-end application.
  - Front-end technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap

### Yeury
I worked on connecting the front-end with the back-end using Flask (a python web framework).
  - I was able to get the data and send it to Phidias who handled creating the models for our predictions.

### Phidias
I worked on the model prediction algorithm using Tensorflow.
  - I was able to get the Flask data to create a graph and send it as a response.
